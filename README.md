# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

## Overview
This project uses SQL to analyze COVID-19 data, exploring various aspects such as infection rates, death counts, and vaccination progress across different countries and continents. The analysis provides insights into the global impact of the pandemic and the effectiveness of vaccination efforts.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from two main tables:
1. CovidDeaths: Contains information about COVID-19 cases and deaths.
2. CovidVaccinations: Contains information about COVID-19 vaccinations.

(Note: Please specify the exact source of your data, e.g., "Our World in Data", if applicable)

## Project Structure
The project consists of a single SQL file containing various queries that perform different analyses on the COVID-19 data.

## Analyses Performed

1. **Initial Data Exploration**: Retrieves and displays key fields from the CovidDeaths table.

2. **Death Percentage Calculation**: Calculates the likelihood of dying if contracting COVID-19 in the United States.

3. **Infection Rate Analysis**: Compares total cases to population and identifies countries with the highest infection rates.

4. **Death Count Analysis**: Shows countries and continents with the highest death counts.

5. **Global COVID Numbers**: Provides a summary of total cases, deaths, and death percentage worldwide.

6. **Vaccination Progress**: Analyzes the percentage of population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine.

7. **Advanced Queries**: Uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Temp Tables to perform calculations on partitioned data.

8. **Data Storage for Visualization**: Creates a view to store processed data for later visualization purposes.

## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL Queries
- Joins
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Temp Tables
- Window Functions
- Aggregate Functions
- Creating Views
- Data Type Conversion

## How to Use
1. Ensure you have access to a SQL database with the COVID-19 data tables (CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations).
2. Copy the SQL code from the provided file.
3. Execute the queries in your SQL environment.
4. Modify the queries as needed for your specific analysis requirements.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate data visualizations using tools like Tableau or Power BI.
- Add more recent data to keep the analysis up-to-date.
- Expand the analysis to include more specific regional comparisons.
